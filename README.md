# liquid-store-analysis

I created my own challenge and story for a basic+spatial analysis and also used machine learning (unsupervised, clustering): I worked for a liquor company, DonDrink, that wants to open up some stores in Iowa, USA as a data analyst.

My task was to analyse the market to answer some business questions and provide a pricing forecast for the bottles. Goal is to open up a store with fair prices and the best offer of products for our customers.
